# About
This is a simple application where links can be created and are presented in a list.

# Work in progress!
At the moment GraphQL mutations are not supported and because of this creation of links are not presistent with the database.

# Running the Elm Links app:

Clone the repo and do the following to start the Elm Links app:

  * Install Node packages with `npm install`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * In one terminal, start RethinkDB with `rethinkdb`
  * In another terminal, start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
  * Create new database by going to `localhost:4000/reset`
  * Elm app now running on `localhost:4000`


Explore the database with GraphiQL at `localhost:4000/graphql`
